## About Data Comics for Reporting Controlled User Studies

Scientific literature is notoriously hard to read. It doesn't have to be. We are finding a way to use comics to improve statistical communication and engage people in science reading.

## Nature of the Study

You are about to participate in a workshop that involves: participating in a 120 minutes long workshop, in which you come with a statistical analysis you have done before (e.g. in a scientific paper). This workshop aims to teach you how to create small comic strips for your scientific analysis and insights for publication and dissemination.

You will sit at a table and asked to explain your statistical analysis and design a visual explanation of your analysis and the result. Then you are asked to annotate and give feedback on another participant’s work. Finally, there will be an open discussion about using comic strips and simple interactions to explain the statistical analysis. You will be given full instructions shortly and will be able to ask any questions you may have.

## Risks and benefits

There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research. This workshop is voluntary, and this research will increase our knowledge about learning visual literacy.

## Confidentiality and use of data

All the information we collect during the course of the research will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law. In order to safeguard your privacy, we will never share personal information (like names) with anyone outside the research team. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name. We will store any personal data (e.g., audio recordings, signed forms) using an encrypted hard drive. The anonymized data collected during this study will be used for research purposes. With your permission, identifiable data such as recordings may also be used for research or teaching purposes and may be shared with other researchers or with the general public (e.g., we may make it available through the world wide web, or use it in TV or radio broadcasts).
